# Redwood

Redwood is an implementation of a Decision Forest classifier available as a Rust
library or a command line program. It uses a compact, cache friendly format for
speed.

The algorithm used is a modified version of that described in Geurts, Damien,
and Wehenkel's Extremely Randomized Trees (2008).
